There are some examples here, here is how to run them.
The unstructions refer to running from the source package. No install is 
needed, but if you did install, just change the necessary stuff to your 
install places.

The example directory is divided into data/ and config/, all paths in the 
config files are relative to example/, so you need to change directory to it.

Calibration
-----------

 $ cd example/
 $ python ../ui/cam_calib.py config/cal/cam1.yaml

For the evolutionary calibration:

 $ cd example/
 $ python ../evolution/evo_cal.py config/cal/cam1.yaml

Whenever you hit Ctrl-Z (probably Ctrl-D on windows?) you get the current 
status graphic, and current best solution printed to terminal.

Detection, correspondence, Epipolar lines
-----------------------------------------

 $ cd example/
 $ python ../ui/epi_checker.py config/cal/calib_check.py

Just because this example is in with the calibration doesn't limit you to use
it for other sets of images, like particle images from the experiment. But you
knew that, right?
